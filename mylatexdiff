# Configuring for use with git difftool
# -------------------------------------

# Simply put in your path, and then do:
#
#     git difftool --extcmd=mylatexdiff <arguments>
#
# You may want to configure the following to stop the prompt
#
#     git config --global difftool.prompt false
#
# And perhaps also the following alias to spare you some typing and typos:
#
#     git config --global alias.tdiff 'difftool --extcmd=mylatexdiff'
#
# Examples:
#
#     git tdiff -- report.tex
#     git tdiff HEAD~5.. -- report.tex


OLD="$1"
NEW="$2"

# TODO perhaps move to the directory that the file is in
# to make sure relative imports are handled correctly
# Probably best to generate a random filename, and then check that it doesn't
# exist
latexdiff --ignore-warnings $OLD $NEW >> diff.tex
# TODO make compiler configurable via a git-option
pdflatex diff.tex
# TODO make viewer configurable via a git-option
xpdf diff.pdf
# TODO clean up the mess we made we could just delete all files
# called diff.* but maybe, just maybe that file exist already in the git-repo
